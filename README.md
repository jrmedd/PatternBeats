## Overview

This is a _very_ straightforward drum machine for use with the [PatternCraft](http://patterncraft.co) 8-bit punchcard reader. I created it to help demonstrate some creative applications of the hardware ahead of its Kickstarter campaign in November 2016.

##Â Usage

You'll need a [Max](http:/cycling74.com) license to use these source files. [You can download an OS X binary here](http://jamesmedd.co.uk/software/PatternBeats.zip). Pick a serial port, set the volume and tempo, and slide in a drum pattern.
