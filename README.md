## Overview

This is a _very_ straightforward drum machine for use with the [PatternCraft](http://patterncraft.co) 8-bit punchcard reader. I created it to help demonstrate some creative applications of the hardware ahead of its Kickstarter campaign in November 2016.

## Usage

You'll need a [Max](http:/cycling74.com) license to use these source files. [You can download an OS X binary here](http://jamesmedd.co.uk/software/PatternBeats.zip). Pick a serial port, set the volume and tempo, and slide in a drum pattern.

## PatternMIDI

As part of a piece I'm working on – composing a piece of music for 120+ punchcards – I've started creating a full series of apps to use with PatternCraft. The second of these is PatternMIDI. If both patchers are opened in Max – or Max Runtime – they can also be synchronised with **patterncontrol.maxpat**, which will eventually handle MIDI parameter controls too.
